Creating has been core to who I am since I was a kid. We didn't have a TV, so we read a lot of books, but the books I chose were always the Klutz series crafts and how to guides. I love to create what wasn't there before.

I learned to crochet, cook, sew (poorly), fold, bend, and mend from a young age and have challenged myself to expand my scope since.

I fell in love with web development in my career for largely the same reasons. I wanted to make something that wasn't there before and this was my chance. I love to build experiences that add value and to help people grow.

I am currently working in the leadership team at a tech company. I plan to use this blog as a place to discuss technology, crafting, feminism, and cooking.
